ArcGIS feature download
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WSDOT-GIS/download-arcgis-features.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WSDOT-GIS/download-arcgis-features)

How it works
------------

1. Query map service / feature service layer to get layer info, including the maximum number of features that can be returned.

        http://example.com/arcgis/rest/services/TransportationProjects/PlannedProjects/MapServer/0?f=json

2. Query for all object IDs. The object ID query is not bound by the maximum number of features as most queries are.

        http://example.com/arcgis/rest/services/TransportationProjects/PlannedProjects/MapServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&returnIdsOnly=true&f=json

3. The next step depends on if there are more records than can be returned per query.

    * If the number of OIDs is below the maximum number of features limit, use a query with a "1=1" where statement

            http://example.com/arcgis/rest/services/TransportationProjects/PlannedProjects/MapServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&f=json

    * Otherwise, divide the OIDs into chunks and make multiple queries using the SQL *IN* operator.
